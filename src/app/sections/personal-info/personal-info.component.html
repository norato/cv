      <p class="personal-info__infos--description">
        I am an Angular Specialist that loves creating beautifully written,
        highly performant, and efficient software. Through my 7+ years of
        experience, I have been working in many kinds of fields. That gave me a
        lot of knowledge on clear code, great communication skills and most
        importantly I gained sponge to like learning abilities. I have a passion
        for software testing and automatization, front end architecture, and
        design systems.
